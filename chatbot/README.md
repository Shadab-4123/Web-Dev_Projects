# React Chat Bot Project

This project is a React-based chat interface where users can interact with various text-transforming bots. The application mimics the look and feel of popular messaging platforms like Discord or Slack while demonstrating different text manipulation techniques.

## Features

1. **User Input and Bot Responses**: Users can send messages, and one of six bots will reply with a transformed version of the message.

2. **Multiple Bots with Unique Transformations**: The app features six different bots, each with its own text transformation:
   - **Capitalize First Letter**: Capitalize First Letter of each word.
   - **Reverse Text**: This bot flips the text backwards, like doing a backflip with words.
   - **Add Underscore**: This bot sneaks underscores into the text, wherever it finds spaces.
   - **Repeat Text**: This bot enforces repetition of text.
   - **Capitalize Text**: This bot turns everything into uppercase.
   - **RandomBot**: Randomly applies one of the above transformations.

3. **Simple, Intuitive UI**: The chat interface resembles modern chat apps and is styled to distinguish between user messages and bot responses.

4. **Scroll Feature**: The chat history scrolls as messages are added, ensuring a smooth user experience.

5. **Basic Input Validation**: Users cannot submit empty or invalid messages.

6. **Dynamic Bot Selection**: For each message, a random bot is selected to respond, adding variety to the chat experience.

## Technologies Used

- React (Functional Components, Hooks)
